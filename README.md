### Myself
Dedicated and passionate individual with a strong background in backend development and a burgeoning interest in machine learning and deep learning. With 2 years and 7 months of experience in software development, I have honed my skills in Python, SQL, (C,ProC, Unix). However, my fascination with the transformative potential of artificial intelligence has led me to embark on a journey to explore the realms of machine learning and deep learning.

I have been actively pursuing opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise in the field of Deep Learning. Through self-study, online courses, and hands-on projects, I have been immersing myself in the intricacies of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and data analysis techniques.

My experience in software development has equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaborative teamwork, which I believe are invaluable assets in the field of machine learning.
As I embark on this journey of transition, I am eager to leverage my existing skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to the exciting developments unfolding in the world of artificial intelligence. I am committed to continuous learning, growth, and exploration, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in this dynamic and rapidly evolving field.

### Image Denoising using AutoEncoders
- We ever have faced trouble dealing with a hardcopy that has some ink fallen on or which is unclear or we have wrinkles on that paper and we have that only copy and we want to submit a clear version of that same piece then we can use the following model.
- Used Autoencoder for removing noise from the background image
